    <div class="aboutme-section">
        <p> I am passionate about three things: Tech, Customers Service, and Writing. <br>
            I am a software developer. I work very well with HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT <br>
            to build beautiful, responsive web pages. <br>
                <br>
            I am a researcher and a writer. 
            <br>
            I work with socials to influence your brand. <br>
            I promote businesses through the art of storytelling. <br><br>
            
            I believe that a business plan is only as good as your ability <br>
            to sell to a customer, but do you sell what you do not have?<br>
             If we are what we say we are, then we are our businesses and<br>
              we are what we sell to our audience. <br>
              So, I teach people how to create the reaction of putting <br>
              themselves on that job. <br>
              How hard can it be to engage people in a business conversation?
              <br>
              ...and oh, did I also mention that I am a local guide?
